The optional-silence phone sil occupies 27.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 11.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 18.5 hours of data, or 13.5 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (16,18.1,40)
