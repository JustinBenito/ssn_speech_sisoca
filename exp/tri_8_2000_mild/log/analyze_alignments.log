The optional-silence phone sil occupies 26.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 75.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 6.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.4 hours of data, or 1.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 3.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (18,20.8,44)
