The optional-silence phone sil occupies 25.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 9.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (17,19.4,42)
